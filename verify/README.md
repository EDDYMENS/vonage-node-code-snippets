## Configure with Your Vonage API Keys

To use this sample you will first need a [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own API credentials, rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples, you will need to [buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers).
